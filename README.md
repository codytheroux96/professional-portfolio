## Description:
In this project I made a simple portfolio. I had three sections made on this portfolio which are: About me, My work, and Contact me. The About me section has a short description about me as well as a picture of me, the My Work section has 5 project images that are all functioning links (the first project I did is the biggest) and the Contact me section has three different ways to get in contact with me including a link to my github. All of these sections can be reached without scrolling by using the internal links in the nav bar that I made. This portfolio page is mobile responsive as well and has hover effects on the nav a internal links.
